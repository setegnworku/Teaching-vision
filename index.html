            <div class="content-block" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>My teaching experience in quantitative genetics and animal breeding spans diverse international settings, each offering unique opportunities to engage with students and researchers. At the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Africa, I designed and delivered a comprehensive course tailored for African scientists. This course seamlessly integrated theoretical foundations with hands-on applications in quantitative genetics, empowering participants to apply these concepts directly to their research and fieldwork.

                    In addition to my work at ILRI, I have contributed to teaching at Aarhus University, where I assisted in delivering the support course on quantitative genetics. Specifically, I led exercises and taught chapters on variance components, guiding students through the mathematical and practical aspects of this critical topic. This experience allowed me to refine my ability to break down complex statistical concepts into digestible, actionable insights for learners.
                    
                    Furthermore, I supported the advanced statistics course at Wageningen University, where I developed exercises using real-world datasets. This role reinforced my belief in the importance of bridging theory with practical application, enabling students to connect abstract concepts to tangible research outcomes.
                    
                    Through these varied teaching experiences, I have come to appreciate the value of combining theoretical knowledge with practical examples. This approach not only helps students grasp complex concepts in genetics and statistics but also equips them to address real-world challenges, particularly when collaborating with scientists from diverse backgrounds and research needs.

            <div class="content-block" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>Central to my teaching approach is the use of interactive tools and technology. By developing interactive Shiny applications, I create visual and hands-on ways for students to explore complex genetic concepts. These interactive tools transform abstract theories into tangible experiences, making quantitative genetics more approachable and meaningful for learners.</p>

            <div class="content-block" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>Acknowledging diverse learning preferences, I employ a multifaceted teaching approach. Visual learners benefit from interactive applications and detailed graphical representations, whereas auditory learners gain from structured discussions and comprehensive explanations of key concepts. In my role as a teaching assistant at Wageningen University, I strengthened this approach by crafting exercises using real datasets, helping students bridge the gap between theory and practical application.</p>

            <div class="content-block" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>Working across different countries and continents has not only shaped my teaching approach but has deeply influenced how I connect with people. Living and working as international staff in various countries has taught me to understand different perspectives and ways of thinking. Whether interacting with farmers in Africa, researchers in Europe, or students from diverse backgrounds, these experiences have honed my ability to listen, adapt, and communicate effectively.</p>

                <p>My co-supervisory roles at Aarhus University and International Livestock Research Institute have significantly enhanced my mentorship capabilities, emphasizing the development of students' critical thinking and research independence. I foster a research environment that is both supportive and challenging, encouraging innovative problem-solving. Moreover, having received excellent supervision myself during my master's at Wageningen University, my postdoctoral studies at Aarhus University, Liege University, and Massey University, I have acquired a diverse set of supervisory skills.</p>

            <div class="content-block" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>Each institution excelled in different aspects of mentorship, allowing me to integrate and adapt these varied approaches in my own supervisory style. For example, my strategy with students involves initially encouraging them to think independently, providing guidance as they navigate challenges, and closely monitoring their progress through regular check-ins and during critical phases of analysis. This tailored approach ensures that I am effectively supporting their development while fostering a culture of self-driven inquiry.</p>
